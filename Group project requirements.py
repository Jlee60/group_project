"""## Group project.

Create an application as a group which will have a specific function. You must work as a group and provide three deliverables

1. Declare your project, which is basically a statement of what your application will do .
2. Code the project - test it and ensure the code is working correctly
3. Present the project to the class for grading. 


Your project must include the following:
    
1. Must use at minimum one api with one endpoint
2. Must import and use one module at minimum
3. Must be unique code - You research how to do something, but the code must be your team's code. No Copying directly from the research
4. Must have user input - Your program must be dynamic and ask for user input
5. Must handle errors - i.e wrong type, input is incorrect. Basically I should not be able to crash your program simply by an input
