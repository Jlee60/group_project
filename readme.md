## Welcome to the Group Project Repository
### Group Project - General Description
#### INFO233 -Group Project

 

This is a group project lasting 3 weeks. It begins with Design and concludes with an in-class  presentation on your project.

 

#### General Description:
Create an application as a group which will have a specific function. You must work as a group and provide progress in three Phases. In phase one and two, you will complete the steps of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). In phase three, you will present the project to the class.

 
#### General Program requirements
Your program must include the following:

- Must use at minimum one API with minimum of one endpoint
- Must import and use two modules at minimum
- Must have at least one function declaration
- Must have user input - Your program must be dynamic and ask for user input
- Must handle errors - i.e wrong type, input is incorrect. Basically, I should not be able to crash your program simply by using the program as it was designed
- Must use at least one data type – (Tuple, List, Dictionary)
- Must be unique code - You research how to do something, but the code must be your team's code. No Copying directly from the research
- Optional for extra credit, declare a class and create objects with attributes and methods used in the code. 
 

#### Phases
1. Design - This phase will cover steps 1&2 in the software development life cycle.\
  A. What does your program do?\
  B. Who is the intended audience\
  C. Provide at least two specific use cases for the program\
  D. How does it work? What is the user input? How does it handle errors? You will put together all of the features of the program in this phase.\
2. Coding and testing – This phase cover steps 3, 4 & 5\
  A. Code the project to the specification from the Design Phase\
  B. Test the code – Note all of the errors\
  C. Correct the initial errors found\
  D. Deploy the code – so it can be run\
3. Present the project to the class for grading.\
  A. Following the template provided, create a presentation which highlights:\
    1. The design of your program\
    2. The use cases of your program\
    3. The API’s and Modules you used\
    4. What errors did you encounter after initial coding. Highlight at least one error and document what you did to correct it.\
4. A live demonstration of your code from the production repo in github\
